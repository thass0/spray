/* FORMAT OF MESSAGES
 *
 * 1. They start with a capital letter.
 * 2. They do not include tags like 'ERR' or 'WARN'. Those tags
 *    are added automatically.
 * 3. They do not end with a newline character. Line breaks are
 *    automatically added at the end of each message.
 * 4. They do not end with a period. Periods are only used to delimit
 *    sentences inside the message. If appropriate, question or
 *    exclamation marks may be used at the end of a message.
 * 5. They may use standard `printf` formatting.
 *
 * EXAMPLES OF VALID MESSAGES
 *
 * 'Failed to retrieve data'
 * 'Did you forget to initialize this variable?'
 * 'Variable %s has the value %d'     - Expects a string and an integer.
 *
 * EXAMPLES OF INVALID MESSAGES
 *
 * 'ERR: Cannot open file'            - The 'ERR: ' is added automatically.
 * 'Please provide more information.' - The period at the end is not needed.
 *                                      It only adds visual clutter. */
